# About

### Description of Mental Health in Tech Dashboard


The app first provides visual insights about the survey data set which includes countries and number of respondents in each country, number of respondents related to a certain sex, the age range of survey respondents, number of people in the data set who are self-employed versus the number of people who work in a company, number of companies that are in of the tech industry versus the ones that are not, each shown visually in charts (bar chart, density chart, etc. depending on the type of data). The app also contains a dropdown list that includes survey questions. Moreover, the app has radio buttons which allow HR professionals to filter between the respondents pertaining to a particular sex, i.e. female, male, or other; it also has one additional dropdown list which allows HR professionals to filter between the companies that provide wellness program for their employees [wellness_program], or if the company makes it easy to apply for a medical leave for a mental health condition [leave], or if the company provides care options for mental health care [care_options]. These widgets in the app will allow HR professionals to compare and contrast the mental health condition of employees and the relation to those variables, namely the benefits and care options an employer provides for their employees.
